Description
--------------

The zip file contains 674 individual recording temporal annotations for the training set of the NIPS4B 2013 dataset in the birdsong classifications task (original size of dataset is 687 recordings).

Task and dataset description can be found in: http://sabiod.univ-tln.fr/nips4b/challenge1.html

Annotation Files
------------

Transcriptions were produced using Sonic Visualiser: https://www.sonicvisualiser.org/ by an experienced birdwatcher, Hanna Pamula.

Number of missing annotations: 13 (6 of these files contained sounds which could not be unambiguously labelled and the rest 7 of them only included insects)

The original (weak) labels provided during the NIPS4B 2013 challenge were used for guidance. However, some files were judged to have a slightly different set of species present than was given in the original metadata.

Extra Unknown label was added to the dataset for the vocalisations that couldn't be classified to a specific species. Also, extra Human label was added for a few recordings that had human sounds present in them.

Transcription format:
[Starting time (sec)],[Duration of event (sec)],[Label]
