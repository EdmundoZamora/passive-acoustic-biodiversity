    "Normally, rainfall would be like background noise, making it very hard to detect on a spectrogram. However, the power spectral density shows the energy (power) at a given frequency in a different format that allows us to notice whether the energy is weak or strong. On the 600-1200 Hz frequencies, there is a higher energy reading when there is rain, meaning we can interpret spikes in the 600-1200 Hz frequency as rain. However, it's still not enough to just use the power spectral density, as other animals or anthropogenic sources also emit sounds on that 600-1200 frequency. Thus, the signal to noise ratio is used to determine whether the sound is rainfall or something else. The signal to noise ratio is basically the ratio between a wanted sound to noise - the ratio was determined using complicated math you can read about in the paper. "
