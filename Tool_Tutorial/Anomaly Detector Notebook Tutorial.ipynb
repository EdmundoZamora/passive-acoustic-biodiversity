    "Normally, rainfall would be like background noise, making it very hard to detect on a spectrogram. However, the power spectral density shows the energy (power) at a given frequency in a different format that allows us to notice whether the energy is weak or strong. On the 600-1200 Hz frequencies, there is a higher energy reading when there is rain, meaning we can interpret spikes in the 600-1200 Hz frequency as rain. However, it's still not enough to just use the power spectral density, as other animals or anthropogenic sources also emit sounds on that 600-1200 frequency. Thus, the signal to noise ratio is used to determine whether the sound is rainfall or something else. The signal to noise ratio is basically the ratio between a wanted sound to noise - the ratio was determined using complicated math you can read about in the paper. "

    "Below is our code we developed based off of the paper. While the code here is similar to rain_cal.py, there are some differences, but not very noticable. While it was developed as a rain detection system, it struggles with differentiating between rain and wind. However, it also works well as an anthropogenic noise detection system after we set the min_psd value to 2 (we will show how to modify the code to detect anthropogenic noises). It also works well to find any sound files that have too much electrostatic interference. "
